Changes:

- Buttons have changed into groups

- Even deeper group nesting. Now there are groups below the groups in the scroll area

- The index order of the notifications no longer matches the visual order, so we have to manually figure out which one is at the top


Notes:

Can't get AXAttributeDescription from Applescript it seems

Roles and subroles we care about:
AXGroup
- AXNotificationCenterAlert
- AXNotificationCenterAlertStack
AXButton
